# Note taker API 
  
  ## Description

  This is a website that has a landing page and a second page where you can write and save notes. This project helped me better understand Express.js and Insomnia. My biggest struggle was manipulating the data in the way I wanted. Fortunately, Insomnia saved me a lot of headaches.
